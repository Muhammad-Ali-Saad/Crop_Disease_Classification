# Crop_Disease_Classification
Using Python, we employed the ResNet18 and ResNet50 models to detect diseases in different crops. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and consisted of 31,053 images of Bangladeshi crops, including rice, wheat, corn, and potato. We leveraged these models to identify and classify crop diseases accurately.
